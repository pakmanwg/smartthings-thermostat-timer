# smartthings-thermostat-timer
Simple thermostat timer smartapp for smartthings. 

Usage:
- create a simulated switch device or button device in IDE
- setup the app to use the new simulated switch or button and config the time, cool and heat temperature, default cool and heat temperature.

Integration with other smartapps:
- nest can be used if you install tonesto7 nest manager app
- Either switch or button can be used. I am using switch because it can be easily integrated with Amazon dash using redloro dash smartapps.
