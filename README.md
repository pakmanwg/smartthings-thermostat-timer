Smartapp for smartthings thermostat timer

A simple thermostat timer for smartthings. Usage
- create a simulated switch device or button device in IDE
- setup the app to use the new simulated switch or button and config the time, cool and heat temperature, default cool and heat temperature.

Either switch or button can be used. I am using switch because it can be easily integrated with Amazon dash using redloro dash smartapps.
